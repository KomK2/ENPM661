 > When providing start and goal values for pathfinding or navigation tasks, ensure that these coordinates are within the defined boundary of the search area and are not located within any defined obstacles. This is crucial for the algorithm to work correctly and to find a valid path from the start to the goal.

 > use the following coordinates for inital and final coordinates:
 inital :(6,6), goal :(1173, 473)
 provide the coordinates with x>5 and x<1195 and y >5 and y< 495

 > install the following packages : numpy, math, matplotlib, cv2, queue
