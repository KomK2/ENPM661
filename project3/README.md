You need the following libraries to run the code
numpy, cv2, math, queue, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.path

Steps to Run the code:
1. Run the given a_star_kiran_abhinav.py file.
2. Enter the x coordinates, y coordinates and orientations of the start and goal node one by one.
3. The orientations should be multiple of 30 degrees.
4. Enter the clearance of the robot.
5. Enter the stepsize of the robot ( 1 - 10 ).
6. You will get the output of optimal path on the map.
7. The video will get saved in the background with Node exploration and Optimal path.

The uploaded video has the start node as (440,200,60) and goal node as (1173,473,30). Taken Clearance is 5mm, and Step size as 7.
